# Editing source code
You will NEED my fork of UTMT that I made specifically for working on cyop, get it here: https://github.com/GithubSPerez/UndertaleModTool

Open it with VisualStudio2022 or higher and compile it, then you can continue.

The "data" folder needs to be in the same directory as the "data.win" file. If your .win file has another name rename the folder to that.

Compile UTMT from VisualStudio, open data.win and that's all, you should be able to edit every code file exactly as I was able to.

# Issues section is only for bug reports!!
